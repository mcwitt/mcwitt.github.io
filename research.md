I study "complex systems", in which relatively simple interactions between a
large number of entities give rise to complex "emergent" behavior which is
often difficult to understand from first principles.

Mainly I have worked on models of "spin glasses", magnetic materials with
disordered (random) interactions between their constituent atoms or molecules.
Although spin-glass models were originally invented to capture the essential
physics of real materials in a lab, they quickly became a field of study in
their own right as it was realized that they are among the simplest models
displaying universal signatures of complex systems. Analytical and numerical
tools originally developed in the study of spin glasses have been applied
successfully in diverse fields, notably in the study of neural networks and
general-purpose optimization algorithms.
